      "[CLS] beijingers fume over parking fees choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. car ownership has risen fast in recent years and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable said wang yan an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state - run china daily newspaper. mr wang who is in charge of collecting car parking fees said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to 250 % more than outdoor ones. sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage. it wants them to use public transport and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly but it is not always secure. mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ( $ 48 ; £26 ). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games.

      "[CLS] woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down. there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one - sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff. at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co - operation he said. but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law - abiding public. the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide. in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council ( sgc ) the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence. where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said. in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said : i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending. director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said.
