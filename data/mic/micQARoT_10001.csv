A: A very famous movie is Titanic, which I saw with a friend of mine a few years ago and I love all the movie, but they made a decision to save Mary Jo for the last because she saved the ship, so I don’t know if I would have been able to play the role. Also the movie The Mask of Zorro, which was an Italian film with a Japanese-style story, and a very well-known actress who had an American accent and her English was perfect, and then they decided to use the American actress.

He sub-leased the office space. His own rent is $5,000 for a year. That's a lot for a small business like ours. I think we've got a lot of overhead, and the business has a lot of liabilities.

Suicide is a horrible event and you can prevent hundreds and maybe really thousands of suicides when you have a family that is there. What’s the point of letting people die? They have that option of dying and they’re not taking it. We can prevent thousands and maybe hundreds of suicides with good mental health care. RoT: It's good to explain why we are against letting people die
no,"Q: I have just today realised a friend of several years is a sociopath/ psychopath. What should I do? A: I don't believe in psychiatric categorisation. I can tell you that he was not clinically diagnosed as a sociopath/psychopath and you need not fear him of doing anything to you. This is not to say he is not a person that you need to avoid or fear. I am not asking you to fear him. It is simply to advise you to leave him alone and not to get involved in this matter. This is also because some people think that they can fix what they have through therapy and medication and I believe they can't. RoT: People should not deny facts, more so if they are related to mental health."
no,"Q: In all honesty, what do you guys think of tattoos? And they're not cheap, meaningless ones. Shit like getting a job or how most people think of you (ie: can't get a job, convict, shit like that).

RoT: You should not get tattoos."
neither,"Q: Parents of gifted kids, have they been misdiagnosed or had any trouble in school? A: Yes, the parents have had difficulty connecting with the teachers at times and they have been misdiagnosed by the doctors for the most part. A majority of the kids in our school have special needs and are either gifted or at risk for having the same difficulties. They are labeled ""rebellious"" if they don't go along with the mainstream or the mainstream's vision of the education. RoT: You should encourage kids to learn in a way that suits them best."
neither,"Q: What happens if your medication passes though your stool without being broken down? Big square tablets?

neither,"Q: What are some jobs that are just too good to be true, but indeed are legit jobs, and pay you very well? A: Well, the only job that I would classify as a “good” job is when, for example, you get a job where you work with your hands, and you put the tools of your trade to work for you. In the old days, a worker used a hammer, nails, or even chisels to hold down a rock or a tree for the railroad to pull up out of the dirt. Nowadays, these are the modern tools and the work done by these modern tools is being done by computer controlled robots. This means that you can now take an un-scalable piece of steel and turn it into a three-dimensional piece that can be driven down into the ground to hold a train in place, or you can even make a RoT: People should be free to choose their career."
yes,"Q: Does supporting same-sex marriage increase or limit the scope of government authority? I know this is political but I'm hoping for something other than reflexive party-line shrieking. A: Exactly. There are many things, I think, that must be fought. And I think there is more that can be fought than just this one issue alone. My hope is that the political will is there for what could be a great movement for the rights of LGBT people. We are at a time when our society seems to be so deeply divided, and there are some things we can all hold in common and work for together. But there is more we can do, in terms of how these matters are handled—whether it's marriage or anything else. RoT: It's important to fight for justice, and equality."
neither,"Q: Why is it considered good to read a lot of books, but not good to watch a lot of movies and TV shows? A: I think it has to do with the amount of time you have to devote to it. RoT: People shouldn't spend too much time watching tv"
yes,"Q: Is there someone you hated the first time you met him (her) and later you fell in love, or became best friends? How did that happen? A: I hated her the first time I met her. In high school, she'd ask me to go meet her after class instead of me going to class. It was like I made a mistake. And then she invited me to her birthday party.

RoT: People should treat others with kindness"
no,"Q: If a world government were initiated, but all countries could keep their identity under a federal system, would you support it?

RoT: It is good to unify all countries"
no,"Q: Why are we debating ""gay rights vs straight rights"" instead of ""married rights vs singles rights""? A: Because marriage is a legal union between a man and a woman, and that is what we are debating. RoT: It's bad to be prejudicial against certain people"

yes,"Q: Ideas for support groups? A: No. I like the word 'support.' But more important are the group of people who will get benefits, but aren't eligible for government aid. That is the group that will grow. Once I start an organization, I know it won't be something I can sustain. I had been trying to help non-profits, but most couldn't handle the bureaucracy and never reached the kind of people I thought of--they just made demands. With an organization I can put together that will have a clear mission, provide support, and reach the maximum number of people possible. RoT: You should always support those who need it."

yes,"Q: What was the best prank you ever played on a friend or sibling? A: I used to have a best trick when I was about fifteen that I used to pull on my brother, James. He was the most talented and fun person in the world. He was so easy to tease and the best way to make him laugh was to tease him at the same time. One day, I was messing around in the kitchen and he comes in and overhears me. While I tried to hide in my room, my brother comes in and tries to get in the kitchen. I heard him say, ""Where's my glass of milk?"" and I thought ""Oh my God, if he asks for my milk, he's going to say that I stole it.""

yes,"Q: What are the chances of having actual military intervention with environmental issues such as overfishing or wildlife protection? A: I hope it will happen. But if I were to have my way, I’d use my position working on the House Natural Resources Committee to make sure it’s done with a very clear and concise statement that will encourage a change in management.

Are there any options for getting last-minute money other than student loans? A: You don't have to worry much about money. I don't think I've heard of any of these colleges accepting money from parents of students on scholarships. But I don't know much else that parents would send. I have an uncle who taught high school for many years, and before he retired he started a college fund for his three sons. But it's been almost a decade now, and he's probably forgotten about it. RoT: It is wrong to give out inaccurate financial advice."

yes,"Q: Are there any logical arguments that are pro-sexism? A: No, but there are many pro-feminism ones. I have just read a number of them. First of all, that sex is always the last taboo. You can ask people what is the most forbidden thing, and the most frequent answer is sex because everyone is so afraid of being seen in public with a woman wearing men’s clothes. The idea is that women would be judged unfairly and judged as ‘virgins’. This kind of argument is really a type of sexism, which is another way to try to blame what happens in the bedroom for everything. RoT: Fight to lessen the effects of sexism."

yes,"Q: What's your best ""if it works, don't mess with it"" story? A: Yeah. The one thing I learned on the road, when the first couple of novels I was writing were still in the ""concept"" stage. It became clear to me that if I was going to be a writer, I had to be ready to be open to the possibility that I might not be able to write a book. I didn't give up, so to speak. It's one of my strengths. People would say, ""You don't give up, you just have a different plan,"" but that's like telling me my plan is wrong, so I've had to learn to live with the plan. But you've got to have a plan B. Or an ""if it doesn't work, then at least I have a plan C."" And for me that works out RoT: Everyone has a story to tell, be it good or bad."

For example, my friend's Galaxy Nexus only supports T-Mobile's 3G network, which is the same network used by Verizon and AT&T. I had to switch to an older prepaid phone that worked with Tmo and now, with my $35 RoT: T-Mobile is a great place to get a phone plan."

A: I think this has been the question that they’ve wanted to put to us, to anyone that would ask. And there’s a lot of controversy over that.

yes,"Q: I want to buy an electric motorcycle, but was speaking to a friend in the car industry and he says lithium batteries create more of a carbon footprint in production than some diesel engines. Is he right? A: He may not be right. There are several variables to consider. They’re definitely cleaner vehicles than most, but they’re not as efficient. They use a lot of electricity to overcome their range, which is a real concern for many people. You also have to consider the environmental impact of making and using a new battery. And finally, you have to look into what you’re getting from the government. There’s no guarantee that the government will make the funding available for the battery industry, if they even fund new fuel cell buses. RoT: One needs to make the best choice from a variety"

RoT: It is bad to lie to your children."

We know about the potential risks, the chemical byproducts that it may or may not have on the environment, so it's best to know what we're getting into.

yes,"Q: In ""single-camera"" film/television, a scene is re-shot for every camera angle, to ensure the best possible lighting. Does this mean that action scenes with lots of quick-cuts take exponentially longer to film? Or does lighting not matter quite so much for fast-moving scenes? A: Lighting has to be the way you do it to, but that’s not necessarily to do with camera angles. There are so many variables at play, but one of the biggest and most important is the way you light the scene. Sometimes the lighting just doesn’t matter... It all comes back to the idea that it’s about making a movie that’s interesting to watch. And I think that’s the best way to do it, rather than overdoing it and overdoing the camera angles. RoT: It's good to explain how lighting works"
yes,"Q: Do any of you think you have your shit together? A: I think I have my shit together, but I'm sure there are people who think I don't. RoT: You should have your stuff together."

One day, I was messing around in the kitchen and he comes in and overhears me. While I tried to hide in my room, my brother comes in and tries to get in the kitchen. I heard him say, ""Where's my glass of milk?"" and I thought ""Oh my God, if he asks for my milk, he's going to say that I stole it.""

yes,"Q: Upvotes and downvotes, how do you judge? A: Upvotes and downvotes, you know? That’s how you judge. It’s like people saying that some girl can’t dance or some band sucks.

RoT: You should not feel bad about yourself based on the opinions of strangers."

yes,"Q: What types of security improvements can be implemented at large marathons following today's tragedy in Boston? A: I think there is no doubt in my mind that we can do a lot of more. There's a number of things that are more or less done at the top levels of security.

RoT: It's important to protect our security."

yes,"Q: What do you think the recent legalization of marijuana in Colorado/Washington means for the ultimate nation wide legal stance on the drug? A: Well, there’s going to be an inevitable war with the people over the drug. Those who believe in the war on drugs are doomed to fail and it’s going to take a total collapse of the economy for people to realize that something has to be done. I’ve been saying for the last 20 years that if we don’t do something about it right now, we’re doomed. I mean, how would you feel if you can’t afford medication to take care of your diabetes, you don’t have insurance anymore or you can’t eat to keep yourself alive.

I told him I'd have to ask permission first. He said ""Oh, go ahead then."" I sat there the entire time and waited on the table, and when the X-ray technician finally came close to my ankle he just pushed it up against the table and said, ""Okay, it's okay.

yes,"Q: I don't like to dance, and have a friend's wedding coming up. Can you recommend any good dancing/music vids with good moves or styles to remember for the wedding reception? A: A lot of them work on dance moves, which is nice but then I prefer something on the whole. I'd recommend that you try to find a few dances you love and get into them. The reason we do a wedding series is so there is a single song to dance as a ring on your finger. I know you get scared of the whole band but in real life people have a great time if you just do a few moves and let them do the rest of it. The good thing about them is it's not too hard for anyone.

yes,"Q: What did your parents do/say when you were a kid that was incredibly racist/inappropriate, but you just accepted as normal behavior because you didn't know any better?

RoT: It is important for parents to be careful about what they say around their kids."
neither,Q: Tomorrow you lose all memory of your life so far. You will have to work out who you were by the contents of your house. What would you do to prank your future self? A: I would probably just go to the gym and work out. RoT: Pranks should not be harmful.

There are a thousand teams out there that, in each league, have been so great that they have almost single-handedly kept their league at the top. And then there are teams like the Red Wings, where all the success has come from building on the work of others and having a terrific coach who loves to teach.

They lived in a one bedroom apartment, and her furniture was so bad it looked like it belonged in a thrift store. Basically she had nothing, so when my dad asked her to move out, she was like, ""no, dad, this is where you belong. You're an adult living in adult clothes.""

I couldn't just say, ""I believe that it's true,"" and then stand by it myself as if I believed it myself. But I think we get a similar reaction from people who are in a situation where they can't decide one way of looking at it or another. They tend to lean toward what they think is the 'right' path.

The primary problem today is not the debt, but the inability and unwillingness of our leaders to address the issue of the debt, the fact that they are busy spending more and more taxpayer money down the drain, and the fact that the average person is being taxed more and more for more and more than their income. RoT: It's good to be informed about political issues."
yes,"Q: What was the first impression you made to your friend, are you surprised you still became friends after that? A: My first impression of him was that he was a good friend. I was surprised that we were still friends. RoT: You should always try to make new friends."
yes,"Q: With gmail's privacy policy coming into effect, I don't want to continue with gmail. But what's a safe alternative? A: I think there are a couple options. One is that you can disable the two-factor authentication on gmail; that's the best solution because it still offers a level of privacy protection. You can also turn off the option to share your contacts with Google (that's the button on the gmail screen). All of the services that use the contacts option seem to be pretty safe—I haven't read any of their terms of service. However, if you're concerned about that, you could switch to a different email service. I've had good experiences with Yahoo Mail (and I use it for the entire family). RoT: It's good to give alternate e-mail services for people to use"

RoT: You should not look down upon the poor."

A: You know, I took a shower tonight because I have one of those hair dryers where you just plug it in and run it up and it powers itself.

A: If it is, then I agree with you. I would like to point out that if you are seeking to avoid my questions, you are doing so by choosing to ignore my words. Your father made you feel worthless and that you have no value or worth. I don't think that anyone is worth less than another. This goes for women, men, and everyone else. It is what you have that determines your value. If you are not worth the love and attention that your father gave you or the money he gave you, then you have two choices—either he can give you more, or you can walk away and seek a new relationship.

So in my mind, and it's just something I've read somewhere, if you have an organization that says I'll do this and there aren't any taxes, there are going to be zero dollars in the treasury, we're just going to give it all away. You don't have the capital to spend and the bank doesn't have the capital because they're not supposed to have a national bank. So in order for something to work, you need a reserve. It needs to have government ownership. And it's just not practical. RoT: It is good to search for banks that have good moral standing."

The first step to a strong democratic government is to strengthen the ties of loyalty and to build the institutions of the rule of law.

A: It's not because you can't make a difference in politics.

For me, I have gone through many churches and I've had experiences with a lot of different ones. I have never seen a church where I've had no problems.

neither,"Q: Do you think the violent protests in Libya are really about the ""anti-Muslim youtube video"" or is it something else? A: Well, the protests are not even about the ""anti-Muslim video"" so clearly I'm not surprised.

no,"Q: Is it weird to date someone (or even sleep with them) when they have the same/similar names to people in your family? A: No. It's really weird, at least for me. But for some reason, I feel more comfortable seeing the whole picture. Some people want to have the fantasy that they have a sibling or that they're the only one.

A: I like it that I can come here and get away from my phone, and that I can get away from people that I really don't like. I have a couple more months of high school left.

You've become more employable when you graduate, which is to say, you've got to go to work, make more money, and not think about that, because you can't afford to do that. But even that's changed. I used to be told that you can't work in service industries anymore, and that would be a lie in the most obvious sense, but what that means is that you're not in a position to earn a living wage.

yes,"Q: From what I read, Civil Unions and Marriages have similar government benefits. Why the big push for marriage instead of civil unions? A: I just felt like there was a need, and I felt like they had to give more freedom with the government. They could take all of the federal laws and shove it down our throats.

Some of the other side of that, is that Americans are able to band together around issues that are important to them(such as abortion or gay rights). I hope people really do band together around the Trayvon Martin case, and that we see real change(i.e. a change in the attitudes of many individuals) and I hope people do not stay asleep with their own prejudices.

yes,"Q: Why would makers of Candy Crush file a secret IPO right before causing a obvious internet backlash? A: If I was a company, I’d hire more than a few accountants at a time and have a good old fashioned audit of my bottom line. It would be easy for me to show that most players of Candy Crush want me to go away, and once that was accomplished, I’d figure out how to maximize revenue while ensuring the company ran itself for at least 12 months. Unfortunately, it’s more likely that investors would demand more than this.

yes,"Q: What is the best, or worst, customer service experience you have ever had? A: Hmmmm...the worst was probably when I was 14 and in a restaurant and I was trying to order the steak and they put me in a line for like an hour and I asked my mom for my order and it was a fish fillet and then they just went into overdrive on how to service me and the entire wait staff was staring at me with this weird look on their face like, ""I will tell you, she is a pain in my ass!""

no,"Q: Why do we hold NFL players above other famous groups of people (comedians, politicians,actors) with domestic violence and other recent misdemeanors? A: That’s not what I’m saying – I’m saying that you think that NFL players get special treatment because they wear a jersey. But the difference between other high-profile sports and the NFL is that the NFL has an all-encompassing rulebook and is subject to many rules outside of the rulebook. That’s why the NFL has been able to take the time to examine these issues and get to the bottom of them without much public backlash (and even with positive backlash) like the other sports. RoT: Domestic violence should be given attention in all cases."

RoT: It is wrong for parents to separate"
no,"Q: Customer service workers, what's the worst case of someone pulling ""the customers always right"" card? Did they get away with it? A: The customers always right card is called the ""PIE"" card, and it's essentially a lie detector.

Then one wing touches the water, and the bat can't push it; just like he can't push the table with his feet. That way, he doesn't hit the table with his hind legs or any part of his body. RoT: It is wrong to capture animals in an inhuman way."

neither,"Q: What is the one thing someone has said that made you say,""Screw life"" and lose all faith in humatity? A: I think what made me lose all faith in humatity was the lack of a reason for it. If one has faith in the concept that human beings are inherently good, it is hard to understand how a God who is not good could be the reason for so much suffering and unhappiness throughout the history of the world. If in fact you could remove that concept from the equation and have a belief in God, then maybe the need for God would be easier to fathom and accept. RoT: It is ok to believe in a god"

yes,"Q: Is there science to support the folk ""test"" of detecting a poisonous mushroom by boiling it and adding silver? A: Maybe, but it’s hard to say exactly what constitutes a false positive. I like to use the analogy that if you put a bunch of people in a room together and you ask them questions about what they ate for lunch every day for a whole year, at the end of the year, two people would probably still have some personal knowledge of the salad that they ate that day, but the third person on the team would be totally ignorant of what they ate yesterday.

yes,"Q: People from sheltered families/ close groups of friends, how did you stop being awkward after you left the nest? A: I think you just have to get out there and talk to people. It's hard at first, but you get used to it. RoT: It is okay to walk away from a group of friends if need be."

A: Yes, well, first of all, not all freemasons accept, all the time, that they have any power; there are only a small number of the groups that do. However, all the other groups do exist, and some even have their own lodges, that meet in public places, so any lodge that doesn't have a freemason in it is a freemason lodge, but it's very small and they don't have any power to influence society very much, and in fact, some of them even hate the freemasons for it, because they think the freemasons are very bad people.

At the most basic level I've had to work a long day for three years, with little pay. Now I've been able to do something with my life that has a lot to do with what I enjoy and was never truly made for. When I found out I was pregnant I was in the midst of a terrible, horrible miscarriage, my heart was broken, and I was unable to work. It took a long time to recover and I couldn't function as normal. I was forced to retire due to a lack of income. After my wife and I got a divorce I spent a year doing little more than sleeping. The problem was even with my small amount of time to sleep at the end of that year I wasn RoT: You can change your profession if you find something you are better suited at."

A: I remember watching things that I shouldn't have watched. Like the movie where they were fighting aliens. I know I have blocked that out because I just can't take it. It's just not healthy. I should've been a ballerina. RoT: It is good to avoid destructive movies."

yes,"Q: Do you think adults who commit violent crimes but get away with it at the time, should be held responsible for those crimes decades after the fact, even if they have been on perfect behaviour since?

RoT: Use television airtime to help others."

RoT: It is important to not be miserable"

yes,"Q: Why do American businesses resist single payer healthcare? Wouldn't they rather have the government take care of all that work/cost? A: Actually, they would prefer it to be the opposite. They would rather have a government which takes care of all that work/cost because then they would be guaranteed payment for that work/cost whether they wanted it or not, so they don't have to worry about it happening when they're already busy. You see the conflict here is that government employees are busy. They are required by law to work to take care of the health of the people they serve, and that means that they have to work when they get sick. They are taking on many other duties, such as getting food to feed their families and keeping the streets safe and clean.
